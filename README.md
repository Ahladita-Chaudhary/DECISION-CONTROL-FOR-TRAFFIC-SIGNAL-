# DECISION-CONTROL-FOR-TRAFFIC-SIGNAL-
We are examining traffic lights that are not adjusting per the movement of traffic. We approximate the intersection by modeling it as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and by a Poisson distribution to deal with uncertainty in the arrival of cars at the intersection. This allows us to create a system that is able to make decisions on-the-fly.
