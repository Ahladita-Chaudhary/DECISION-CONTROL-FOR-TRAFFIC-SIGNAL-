help me generate a lecture scribe for Lecture 5 of the course CSE 400 Fundamentals of Probability in Computing
OUTPUT: formal lecture scribe, intended strictly as a exam oriented reference material for reading-based or closed-book revision, I should be able to revise Lecture 5 using only this document, without referring to any external source

Context Restriction: (FOLLOW STRICTLY)
Use only the provided Lecture 5 PowerPoint slides 
Do not use external knowledge, textbook material not explicitly shown, inferred intuition, reinterpretations, or additional explanations
Every definition, formula, example, and derivation must be directly traceable to the provided context

Required Content (Include only if present in the lecture):
Formal definitions and notation
Explicit assumptions and conditions
Clearly stated theorems, propositions, or named results
Proofs or proof sketches written step by step, exactly as presented
Worked examples with all intermediate steps shown

Structural Expectations: (COMPULSORY)

Follow the exact topic order and logical flow of Lecture 5
Organize the scribe using clear LaTeX sectioning (\section, \subsection)
Present theorems, propositions, and formulas in clearly identifiable mathematical environments

Clearly mark proofs and example solutions so they are easy to locate during revision
Exclude any content that is administrative or unrelated to examinable material
Strict Exclusions:
Do not add:
New examples or problems
Intuition, motivation, or explanatory commentary beyond what appears in the lecture
Simplifications, summaries, or textbook-style elaborations
Any reasoning or explanation outside the lecture material
Output Format (Non-Negotiable):
Output only complete LaTeX source code, enclosed within a single
\documentclass … \end{document} block
Do not include any plain text, commentary, or explanations outside the LaTeX code

The LaTeX document must explicitly include:

Course name
Lecture number (Lecture 5)
Group No.: S1 G17
Date
The final output must be a faithful, well-structured, exam-ready reconstruction of Lecture 5, with emphasis on clarity, correctness, and revision usability.
