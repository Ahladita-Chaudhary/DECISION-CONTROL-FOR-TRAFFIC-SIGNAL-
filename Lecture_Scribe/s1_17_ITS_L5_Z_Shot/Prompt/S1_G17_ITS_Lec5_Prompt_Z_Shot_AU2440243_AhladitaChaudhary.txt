Make a lecture scribe that is designed to strictly prepare students to exams. Only the given context of Lecture 5 should be used. No other outside knowledge, assumption, interpretation, or additional explanations should be utilized besides the provided textbook materials and lectures. Provide only those definitions as given, all assumptions as made, all statements of theorems and propositions, and proofs, derivations, and examples worked out, which appear within the given context. Do not add new examples, descriptions, deductions, and other logical processes. give the proper latex format. the following structure is \documentclass[11pt]{article} % ===================== PACKAGES ===================== \usepackage[a4paper,margin=1in]{geometry} \usepackage{amsmath,amssymb} \usepackage{enumitem} \usepackage{fancyhdr} \usepackage{xcolor} % ===================== HEADER & FOOTER ===================== \pagestyle{fancy} \fancyhf{} \lhead{CSE 400: Fundamentals of Probability in Computing} \rhead{Homework Assignment-1} \cfoot{\thepage} % ===================== CUSTOM COMMANDS ===================== \newcommand{\solution}{ \vspace{0.5cm} \noindent\textbf{\textcolor{blue}{Solution:}} \vspace{0.2cm} % --- STUDENT: TYPE YOUR SOLUTION BELOW THIS LINE --- \vfill } % ===================== TITLE ===================== \title{ \normalsize School of Engineering and Applied Science (SEAS), Ahmedabad University \\ \vspace{0.2cm} \textbf{CSE 400: Fundamentals of Probability in Computing}\\ \Large Homework Assignment-1 Submission } \author{} \date{} \begin{document} \maketitle \vspace{-2cm} \begin{center} \begin{tabular}{ll} \textbf{Name:} & {Rushi Moliya \hspace{2.5in}} \\ [1.5ex] \textbf{Enrollment No:} & {AUXXXXXXX \hspace{2.5in}} \\ [1.5ex] \textbf{Email:} & {rushi.m@ahduni.edu.in \hspace{2.1in}} \\ [1.5ex] \textbf{Date of Submission:} & {January 10\textsuperscript{th}, 2026 (11:59 PM) \hspace{1.2in}} \end{tabular} \end{center} \hrule \vspace{0.5cm} % ===================== QUESTIONS & SOLUTIONS ===================== \begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{Question-\arabic*:}, leftmargin=*] % --- QUESTION 1 --- \item A total of 28 percent of American males smoke cigarettes, 7 percent smoke cigars, and 5 percent smoke both cigars and cigarettes. \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)] \item What percentage of males smokes neither cigars nor cigarettes? \item What percentage smokes cigars but not cigarettes? \end{enumerate} \solution % TYPE SOLUTION HERE \newpage % --- QUESTION 2 --- \item In how many ways can 8 people be seated in a row if: \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)] \item there are no restrictions on the seating arrangement? \item persons A and B must sit next to each other? \item there are 4 men and 4 women and no 2 men or 2 women can sit next to each other? \item there are 5 men and they must sit next to one another? \item there are 4 married couples and each couple must sit together? \end{enumerate} \solution \newpage % --- QUESTION 3 --- \item A class in probability theory consists of 6 men and 4 women. An examination is given, and the students are ranked according to their performance. Assume that no two students obtain the same score. \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)] \item How many different rankings are possible? \item If the men are ranked just among themselves and the women just among themselves, how many different rankings are possible? \end{enumerate} \solution \newpage % --- QUESTION 4 --- \item A committee of 5 is to be selected from a group of 6 men and 9 women.

Each question has three alternative answers, of which exactly one is correct. The probability that a student will get 4 or more correct answers just by guessing is: \solution \newpage % --- QUESTION 11 --- \item In the game of bridge, the entire deck of 52 cards is dealt out to 4 players (13 cards each).

You roll the die and flip the coin simultaneously. If the coin shows heads, you record the number on the die. If the coin shows tails, you roll the die again and record the sum of the two rolls. What is the probability that the recorded number is an even number greater than 6? \solution \newpage % --- QUESTION 13 --- \item The coefficients $a, b, c$ in the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ are chosen from the set $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$. If the probability that this equation has one real root bigger than the other is $p$, then the value of $216p$ is: \solution \newpage % --- QUESTION 14 --- \item A bag contains 4 red and 6 black balls. A ball is drawn at random from the bag, its colour is observed, and this ball along with two additional balls of the same colour are returned to the bag. If now a ball is drawn at random from the bag, then the probability that this drawn ball is red is: \solution \newpage % --- QUESTION 15 --- \item A student appears for a quiz consisting of only true–false type questions. The student knows the answers of some questions and guesses the answers for the remaining questions. \begin{itemize} \item Whenever the student knows the answer, he gives the correct answer. \item The probability of the student giving the correct answer, given that he has guessed it, is $1/2$. \item The probability of the answer being guessed, given that the student’s answer is correct, is $1/6$. \end{itemize} Then the probability that the student knows the answer of a randomly chosen question is: \solution \end{enumerate} \bigskip \hrule \vspace{0.2cm} \begin{center} \small \textit{End of Submission} \end{center} \end{document} instead of questions insert the contents from the lectures only
