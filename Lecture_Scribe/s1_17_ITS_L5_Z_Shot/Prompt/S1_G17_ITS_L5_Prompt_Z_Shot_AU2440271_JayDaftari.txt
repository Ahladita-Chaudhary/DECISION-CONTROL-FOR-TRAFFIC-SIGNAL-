Practice: Professional professional Lecture Scribe on CSE 400: Fundamentals of Probability in Computing - Lecture 5 (Bayes Thesis, Random Variables, PMF).I. Professional Purpose and Role Identity: Become a professional academic scribe. This is the graded part of the course and has to be in the form of an academic reference source of closed-note exam.Priority: Technical correctness and absolute adherence to the given scenario of Lecture 5 are all the issues of consideration. Content Scope & Technical RequirementContext Limitation: Use L5A S1.pdf attached. Do not create content, or place extraneous intuition (in particular: no non-academic Randall Munroe/xkcd allusions).
Conditioned probabilities Theories The Law of Total Probability [Formula 3.4], the Bayes Formula [Proposition 3.1]: Reconstruct the Weighted Average of Conditional Probabilities, the Law of Total probabilities (explicitly stating a priori and a posteriori probabilities).
Examples: Provided are example 3.1 (Accident-Prone Insurance), example 3.2 (The Three Cards Problem), and PMF Solved Problem p (i) = c 0.5 Taylor Series Expansion.
Random Variables Faithfully entails motivating and defining discrete random variables III. Zero Shot (Negative Constraints) Discipline.
Banned Words: No mention of the words, as this.
