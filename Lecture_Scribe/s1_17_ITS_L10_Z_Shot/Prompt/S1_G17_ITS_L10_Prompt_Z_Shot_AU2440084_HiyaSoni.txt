help me generate a lecture scribe that is formal for the provided lecture of my course CSE 400: Fundamentals of Probability in Computing.

The scribe must be a strictly as exam-oriented reference material for reading-based or as a closed-book revision. I should be able to fully revise the lecture using only this document, without consulting any external source. 

Context Restriction (Strict):
Use only the provided lecture PowerPoint slides.
Do not use external knowledge, textbook material, inferred intuition, reinterpretations, or added explanations.
Every definition, theorem, algorithm, formula, proof, and example included must be directly traceable to the slides.

Content to Include (Only if present in the lecture):

Formal definitions and notation

Explicit assumptions and stated conditions

Clearly stated theorems or propositions

Proofs or proof sketches written step by step, exactly as presented

Algorithms and pseudocode written faithfully

Worked examples shown in the lecture, with all intermediate steps

Structure and Presentation:

Follow the exact topic order and logical flow of the lecture

Use clear LaTeX sectioning (\section, \subsection)

Present definitions, theorems, propositions, and algorithms in clearly identifiable environments

Clearly label Proof, Algorithm, and Solution blocks for easy exam revision

Exclude any content that is administrative, illustrative, or non-examinable

Strict Exclusions:
Do not include:

Motivation, intuition, or descriptive discussion

Practical demonstrations, simulations, or implementation details

Comparative commentary unless it is explicitly stated as a formal result in the lecture

Any content not directly required for exam revision

Output Format: 

Output only complete LaTeX source code, enclosed within a single
\documentclass … \end{document} block

Do not include any text outside the LaTeX code

The LaTeX document must explicitly include:

Course name

Lecture number (as shown in the slides)

Group No.: S1 G17

Date

The final output must be a precise, structured, exam-ready reconstruction of the lecture, prioritizing correctness, clarity, and revision usability over explanation or narrative.
