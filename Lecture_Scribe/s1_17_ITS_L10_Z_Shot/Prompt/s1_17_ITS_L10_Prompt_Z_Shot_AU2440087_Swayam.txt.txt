Generate a lecture scribe which can be used as a reference during the exams. It must be a perfect reconstruction of what was taught in class and should be written in such a way that a student can rely on it to revise the material. Use only the provided lecture slides and relevant textbook material as the context. Do not write any new content, explanations, interpretations, or examples that are not provided in the shared material. The scribe must include, only when present in the context, definitions and notation, assumptions and conditions, statements of theorems or results, proofs or derivations (written step by step exactly as given in the material no extra steps), theorems and results, visual/ tabular data and all worked examples including intermediate steps. Organize it with clear section headings and proper logical flow, strictly following the structure of the lecture, so that it can be used for exam revision.  Provide me the latex format for this lecture scribe.
