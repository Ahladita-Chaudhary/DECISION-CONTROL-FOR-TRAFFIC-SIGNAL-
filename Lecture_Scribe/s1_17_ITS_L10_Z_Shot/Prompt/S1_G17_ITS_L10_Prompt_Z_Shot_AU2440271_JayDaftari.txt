Task CSE 400: A Professional Lecture Scribe of CSE 400: Fundamentals of Probability in Computing Lecture 10 (Randomized Min-Cut Algorithm).
I. Academic Status and PurposeProfessional academic scribe. This is a determinable and it must be an allusion of close-note tests. Employment: Priority Strict faithfulness to L10s1.pdf. Do not create, or present intuitions/analogies that were not covered in the slides (do not especially introduce non-academic filler). 
II. Introduction to Compulsory Technical Material.
Definitions Have formal definitions cut-set, min-cut problem and edge contraction mechanisms (parallel edges and self-loops). Theorems: State Max-Flow Min-Cut Theorem capacity/flow definition and the success probability of the min-cut set (no less than 2/n(n-1)) Theorems. Node-Specific Reconstruction: In Successful Run (Slide 19) and the Unsuccessful Run (Slide 22), the order of the merging the nodes (e.g. 1: Nodes 3 and 4 are merged into supernode {3,4}) is displayed in the order so that the logic can be re-created without the image. Phase and Minimum Cut based on the StoerWagner logic Phase and Minimum Cut Algorithms Phase and Minimum Cut Algorithms 1 (Phase) and 2 (Minimum Cut). Critical Correction: There is a case where n = alpha3 which is the base case in the Algorithm 3 ( RecursiveRandomized Min-Cut ). It is only so in the case of Slide 35. Complexity: Does it scale up to the same complexity O(VE+ V 2 log V) as O( V 2 ) does? 
III. Negative Constraints are hampered.
* Forbidden Language: One should not use such words as for example and like this. No Fluff: Do not give an introductory or a conclusion summary. The scribe must halt at the intersection of the technical contents. Output formatting: It is compulsory that the customers should merely place the complete source code of the LaTeX containing the documentclass and the end of document. 
IV. LaTeX TemplateThe template should have the following format:
